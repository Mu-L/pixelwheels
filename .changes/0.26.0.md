## 0.26.0 - 2024-09-03

### Added

- The Pixel City championship got its 3rd track: The Island.

- The "rotate camera" option is back! Thanks to Compl Yue for this work!

- Pixel Wheels now speaks Galician, thanks to Ninjum!

### Changed

- In the menus, the "back" and "next" buttons are now reachable via keyboard navigation.

- The AI pilot got a bit smarter: it knows about the different ground materials and tries to overtake vehicles instead of bumping into them.

- The Spanish translation is now maintained by Victor Hck.

- The behavior when hit by a bullet, missile or when triggering a mine is now less punishing. Instead of doing a 360 and getting pushed away, the vehicle motor temporarily shuts down and emits smoke (#418).

- The support part of the configuration screen has been moved to a nicer, dedicated "SUPPORT" screen. This screen provide links to Pixel Wheels shop and to the support page (on builds where it is authorized).

- The BRGP42 and Rocket vehicles are now a bit faster.

- Steering is now smoother, especially on Android.

### Removed

- Desktop: moving mouse over a menu item no longer makes it the current item.

### Fixed

- Helicopter behavior has been improved: there should no longer be stuck helicopters, or continuously playing helicopter sounds.
