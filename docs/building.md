# Building Pixel Wheels

The Docker-based build is simpler but the manual build gives you more control.

## Docker-based build

### Setup

Make sure Docker is setup on your machine.

To run your newly-built game you will at least need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

Run the `ci/build-docker-image` script.

### Building

Run the `ci/docker-build-game` script.

### Running the game

```
cd android/assets
java -jar ../../desktop/build/libs/desktop-1.0.jar
```
