Pixel City championship got its 3rd track: The Island.

Getting hit by a bullet, missile or driving on a mine is less punishing: now the vehicle motor temporarily shuts down and emits smoke.

Steering is now smoother.

The AI pilot got smarter: it knows about the different ground materials and tries to overtake vehicles instead of bumping into them.

The BRGP42 and Rocket vehicles are a bit faster.

The "rotate camera" option is back.

Pixel Wheels now speaks Galician.
